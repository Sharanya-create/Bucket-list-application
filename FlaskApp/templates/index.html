             A bucket list is nothing but just a list of the things that a person would like to do or achieve before they die. The Etymology goes like,From kick the bucket (“to die”) + list, hence a “list of things to do before you die”. The term was coined by American and British screenwriter Justin Zackham in his screenplay for the 2007 film The Bucket List. Zackham had created his own list called “Justin’s List of Things to Do Before I Kick the Bucket” which he then shortened to “Justin’s Bucket List”. The first item on his list was to have a screenplay produced at a major Hollywood studio. After a time, it occurred to him that the notion of a “bucket list” could itself be fodder for a film, so he wrote a screenplay about two dying men racing to complete their own bucket lists with the time they had left. Articles about the movie are the earliest known uses. This app helps you to get 101 goals of yours' in one place all you need to do is type in your goal in the text box provided and it will be added in the home page which is accesible only if you sign up and its completely free, so why not have some bucket lists that always remind you of the things that you want to achieve. Having a Bucket list will even help you from kicking off your laziness, everytime you see your bucket list it will remind you about your goals and there you go laziness can be easily avoided, one who wants to overcome one's lethargic behaviours can keep a habit of listing out goals. Okay! Lets create a list now!!
